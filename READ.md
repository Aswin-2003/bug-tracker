# Simple Bug Tracker 🐞

A basic bug tracking web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This was created as a personal project to demonstrate front-end development, user interaction, and localStorage handling.

## ✨ Features

- Submit bugs with a title and description
- View reported bugs
- Mark bugs as resolved (with visual status update)
- Stores data using browser's localStorage

## 📸 Screenshot

## 📂 Files

- `index.html` – Main page layout
- `app.js` – JavaScript logic to manage bugs

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone/download this repo
2. Open `index.html` in any browser

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Add date/timestamp to each bug
- Add search or filters
- Store data in a real backend
